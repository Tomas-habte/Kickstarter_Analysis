# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Project Overview
---
The purpose of this analysis is to determine how different fundraising campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. This can help to assess how a fundraiser has performed compared to other fundraisers on Kickstarter.

## Analysis and Challenges
I performed the analysis by first using Excel formulas to pull data that I needed from the dataset. I then created a chart and a pivot chart from the data.

A challenge I faced was using the COUNTIFS formula to get the number of projects that were successful, failed, or canceled. I was only getting zeros, so I searched online but my formula still looked right so I reached out to my classmate and they were able to show me the part of the formula that was causing the error.

## Results
**Two conclusions about the Theatre Outcomes by Launch Date**
- Theatre projects launched in May and June are the most successful.
- Theatre projects launched in December are the least successful. 

**One conclusion about the Outcomes based on Goals**
- Projects with lower goals are more likely to be successful. 

**Limitations of the dataset**
- This dataset is from pre-pandemic times so it may not reflect the present-day reality. 
- This dataset is only from Kickstarter so the overall trends could be different if data from other crowdfunding sites were included.


**Possible charts/graphs that could be created**
- Chart on average pledge against project success/failure rate to determine if there is a relationship between pricing and success/failure rates of projects.
